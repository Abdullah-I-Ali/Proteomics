# ðŸ§ª Normalization

Normalization is used to correct systematic variation between samples to make them comparable.
Examples include:
- Median normalization
- Quantile normalization
- Variance Stabilization Normalization (VSN)
- Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (PQN)

Normalization adjusts **between samples**.
